 1. Install the Firefox DEB Package on Ubuntu

If you donâ€™t like the Snap version of Firefox, you can install the Firefox DEB package via APT. For this, you will need to add the Firefox PPA, give it priority over the Snap package, and then install Firefox using APT.

To add the Mozilla Firefox repository, run the following:

        
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa

    

If you get the "add-apt-repository: command not found" error, simply install the software-properties-common package to fix the issue.

You may be prompted for admin credentials. After adding the repository, update the repository index with:

        
sudo apt update

    

Now create the file /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla using any text editor such as nano:

        
sudo nano /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla

    

Add the following lines to it:

        
Package: firefox*
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

    

Save and close the file when done.

Alternatively, run the following command (all at once) in your terminal to perform the above steps:

        
echo '
Package: firefox*
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001
' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/Mozilla

    

Now you can install the Firefox DEB package via APT:

        
sudo apt install firefox

    

If you want to automatically update Firefox whenever a newer version gets released, you will need to configure it by running:

        
echo 'Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins:: "LP-PPA-mozillateam:${distro_codename}";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades-firefox

    

Remove the Firefox DEB Package From Ubuntu

You can remove an application using APT if you no longer require it. To remove Firefox from Ubuntu, run:

        
sudo apt remove firefox

    

2. Install Firefox on Ubuntu via Snap

On Ubuntu 22.04 and later versions, Firefox comes preinstalled as a Snap package. However, if you've accidentally removed Firefox or are using an older Ubuntu version, you can still install Firefox as a Snap package.

To do this, you must first install snapd on your system if it is not already installed. Once installed, install Firefox on Ubuntu with:

        
sudo snap install firefox

    

To verify the installation, view the installed Firefox version with:

        
firefox -v

    

Uninstall the Firefox Snap Package

To uninstall Firefox from Ubuntu, run:

        
sudo snap remove firefox

    

3. Install Firefox on Ubuntu via Flatpak

Another way to install Firefox on Ubuntu is through Flatpak. However, you will first need to install Flatpak on your system. Install it by running:

        
sudo apt install flatpak

    

Then, add the Flathub repository with:

        
sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

    

Now, to install the Firefox Flatpak package, run:

        
flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox

    

Once installed, you can launch Firefox using:

        
flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox

    

Uninstall the Firefox Flatpak Package

To uninstall the Firefox Flatpak package, use the following command:

        
sudo flatpak uninstall org.mozilla.firefox

    

4. Installing Firefox on Ubuntu From Source

Mozilla Firefox also provides a TAR archive on its official website. Follow the below steps to install Firefox from source on Ubuntu:

Download the Firefox TAR.BZ2 package from the Firefox downloads page or use the following command to download the Firefox latest version (as of this writing) from the terminal:

        
wget https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/116.0/linux-x86_64/en-GB/firefox-116.0.tar.bz2

    

Download: Mozilla Firefox

Then, use the cd command to move to the directory containing the downloaded file and unpack the contents of the archive using the tar command:

        
tar xjf firefox-*.tar.bz2

    

It will create a new directory named firefox in your current terminal directory. Use the mv command to move this directory to /opt:

        
sudo mv firefox /opt

    

Next, create a symbolic link to the Firefox executable with:

        
sudo ln -s /opt/firefox/firefox /usr/local/bin/firefox

    

To launch Firefox from the applications menu, download a copy of its desktop file and save it to /usr/local/share/applications:

        
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/sumo-kb/main/install-firefox-linux/firefox.desktop -P /usr/local/share/applications

    

Now you can launch Firefox either through the applications menu or by running:

        
firefox

    

Uninstall Firefox From Ubuntu

To uninstall Firefox that you have installed via its TAR archive, remove the /opt/firefox directory using the rm command:

        
sudo rm -r /opt/firefox
